Howdy Earth! Hopefully this will be the first of many installments on this blog. I have tried, albeit unsuccessfully in the past to get this going, but its definitely going to work this time!

# What is this?


This will hopefully be a creative avenue for me! I am using this opportunity to sharpen my web development skills, personal writing capabilities, as well as to share with others guides on how to solvecertain problems I have stumbled upon over the years


## Who am I?

I am Timothy Jeffrey Cole  a PhD student at East Carolina University in Biology. I use bioinformatics tools to answer questions about venom evolution in spiders. 

# That's it for now!

I don't have too much to add for now. I just wanted to get the ball rowling on this. Toodles for now, until next time.
